# RestFull_API_BLOG_with_authentication
editable blog with login interface 
This is a Blog webpage created 
        ~ USING FLASK Server
        ~ using REST API for editing the page
        ~ added authentication using Flask Login
        ~ created WTForm for user interface
        ~ CKeditor for comment sections
        ~ using SQLITE3 and sqlALchemy for Relational database Management
        ~ hosted the app using heroku  -- > https://divya-blog.herokuapp.com/
        
I have entirely concentrated task on backend development using FLASK and the frontend structure is actually
downloaded for free from startbootstrap
